# AI_Poseture_Tracking_Trainer
Description: This repository contains Jupyter notebbook scripts demonstrating pose estimation using MediaPipe and OpenCV. It provides functionality for processing static images as well as live webcam input, annotating detected poses in real-time.

* This project utilizes the MediaPipe library for pose estimation.
* OpenCV is used for image processing and webcam input.

## Features:

* Process static images for pose estimation.
* Perform real-time pose estimation using webcam input.
* Annotate detected poses on images or video streams.
* Easy-to-use scripts with minimal setup.

## Installation:
1. Install the required dependencies on Jupyter notebook:
```bash
! pip install mediapipe opencv-python
```
2. Give Permission to web camera access:

3. Run the cells one by one on Jupyter notebook:

4. The Final Output:
